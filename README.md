## Overview

Goose is a fun and simple Discord bot framework that simulates phone calls between users in a server. This code is designed as a reference implementation for developers to integrate into their own Discord bots, not as a hosted service. Therefore, there is no invite link.

## Features

- **Anonymous Phone Calls**: Connect with other users without knowing who they are
- **Simple Interface**: Start calls with `!call` and end them with `!end`
- **Thread-Based**: Uses Discord threads for clean organization
- **Real-Time Communication**: Messages in one thread are forwarded to the connected thread
- **Auto-Archiving**: Calls are automatically archived when ended

## How It Works

1. A user types `!call` in any channel
2. The bot creates a thread for that user's "phone call"
3. When another user also initiates a call, the bot connects the two threads
4. Messages sent in one thread appear in the connected thread
5. Either user can end the call with `!end`

## Commands

- `!call` - Start a new phone call
- `!end` - End the current call (only works in call threads)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.2 or higher

   export BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ```

3. Build and run the bot:
